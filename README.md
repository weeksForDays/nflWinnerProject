This is Elliott Weeks and Peter Martin's project for Introduction to Data Science. We scraped data from Super Bowl winning teams and configured the data into an SQL schema to analyze what makes them a winning team. The data used is publicly available on Pro Football Reference: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/
